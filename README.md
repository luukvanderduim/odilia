# Odilia Screen Reader

<!-- Todo: Add badges here -->

## Welcome to Odilia!

Odilia is a screen reader for the Linux desktop.
It's written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org), for maximum performance and stability.

## Status: Beta

This is **absolutely not production ready in any way!**
Everything is in a fairly early stage and we're changing things on a daily basis.
However, Odilia is *somewhat* useable, and will not crash randomly or cause weird behaviour in other applications.
Try it out! See if it works for you!

## Building

To build odilia:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/odilia-app/odilia
cd odilia
cargo build --release
# At this point the compiled program is at ./target/release/odilia
# Optionally, run this to install Odilia to ~/.cargo/bin:
cargo install --path .
sudo ./scripts/setup_permissions.sh
```

### Udev Permissions

Odilia uses the Linux kernel's [evdev interface](https://freedesktop.org/software/libevdev/doc/latest/) to listen for
and redirect events from input devices, such as your keyboard and mouse.

Evdev is normally a privileged interface, since any application that can access it could use it for malicious purposes,
for example, creating a keylogger. For this reason, to run Odilia, you must give yourself access to evdev. This can be
done by running the [scripts/setup-permissions.sh shell
script](https://github.com/odilia-app/odilia/blob/main/setup-permissions.sh) included with Odilia. The script adds some
udev rules, then creates an odilia group. Any users added to this group and the `input` group will be able to run
Odilia.
